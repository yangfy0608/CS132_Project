# CS132 Project1 Week4 Report

CS132 Project1 Elevator Group 29

**Author**: Lian Yihang (Requirement)

## Work this week

1. Collect and analyse customer's **user requirements**.
   - functional : UI, door & movement controls, ...
   - non-functional : constraints on physical environment
   - domain : elevator sensor details and safety measurements

2. Have a meeting to discuss **ambiguous user requirements** and prepare questions to consult.
   - `Only one elevator can reach basement (-1)`

   - `Elevator move by the sensor`

3. Sketch a **Use Case Diagram** and **Class Diagram** using UML to model the system roughly.

4. Invent a **standard format and markdown template** for weekly report and requirement specifacation.

## Questions prepared for the instructor team

Q1: What does `Only one elevator can reach basement` exactly mean? 是两台电梯不能同时到地下还是只有一台指定的电梯能到地下？

Q2: What does `Elevator move by the sensor` exactly mean? What type of movement (direction/position) can we learn from the sensor?  传感器是装在两层楼之间识别电梯是否通过的还是装在电梯里简单判断电梯是否在移动中的？（传感器的具体位置与接口内容）

Q3: Any information or interface for us to help handle the elevator failure (eg.stuck between floors)?

## Schedule next week

1. **Consult TAs about vague requirements** and make them more specific. Convert user requirements to system requirements to sketch the **requirement specification**.

2. Finish the **Use Case diagram** and **Class Diagram**.

3. Learn and sketch more diagrams using UML to model the system further.
   - Sequence diagram
   - Activity diagram
